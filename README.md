## Architecutre

This project was built with a focus on segregating domain specific logic from technical details. For this purpose, a hexagonal architecutre was utilized, as ilustrated through the screenshot bellow.

Each of these Areas get represented by their own C# project, as seen in the source code.

Heavy use of dependency injection and the repository pattern furtheremore lead to looser coupling and a stronger seperation of concerns.

### The Database schema is seen bellow
